<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<hr />
    <p>When I'm not working, you'll likely find me camping in the woods, hiking with my dog, or spending quality time with my wife and family.
     I also have a small craving for adrenaline, which I occasionally satisfy through skydiving, mountain biking, or other exciting outdoor activities.
     Being immersed in nature helps me stay grounded and inspired.
